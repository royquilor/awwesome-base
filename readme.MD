# Awwesome base design system

Hi there, if you follow along the [Youtube video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC95lkG1mOEIU3ciOeBWRwTA) or follow on the [blog](https://www.awwesome.com) you can download these stylesheets. 

They are quite simple to begin with and are mainly based on variables for:

- Font size
- Spacing

Will also use a lot of utility classes as I like to iterate on the designs as we go along. Some of these classes are 

- Flex
- Grid
- Multi-column
- Center
- Widths

These are the classes that I find myself using quite a lot.
